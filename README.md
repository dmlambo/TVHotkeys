# TradingView Hotkeys Extension
## Installation and Use
Run `npm install` and use your browser's extension debug menu to temporarily add the extension.

From the extension's option menu, add hotkeys and set bindings by clicking on the "No Binding" button. Hotkeys must have at least one modifier (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Meta) and only have one non-meta key. Multiple bindings will be triggered if they share the same hotkey combination. 

**Note:** You must open the Paper Trading sidebar before using the extension, otherwise nothing will happen. 

## Warning
This extension uses various undocumented back-alley objects to achieve its goal. Don't expect it to work forever. Open issues as you find bugs.
